# SIIM ISIC Melanoma Classification using ResNet50 Transfer learning
An implementation of model classifying Melanoma (malignant) against Benign conditions using ResNet50 Image classification model. Work under progress

### Data set
Find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification)
- The dataset is a 1024x1024 sized image with around 98% records being Benign and rest being Malignant.
- The dataset is huge with around 33k high resolution images and harder to train on.
- Made use of the Kaggle's TPU facility to reduce the computation complexity.
